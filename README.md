# Karmera V2
What new things were added?
__________________________
This project got completely transformed to a full stack application instead of just a front end application. This project did also get converted into react making many sections turned into components including : 
- Header
- Navigation Slider
- Footer
- Products
- Footer

Each page and component in this project is inside its own folder to contain a CSS file and a JS file to make expandability a lot easier in the future while also making the project a lot more readable.

The backend got added in with a mySQL database which allows you to grab all the products from there. This was all done through API calls and creating a normalized database.

Somethings I want to add in the future? 
____________________________________
I would love to have many new additions in the future for this project. Some of these additions include 
- Manager log in
- Customer log in
- Products page to show details on a product
- Learn to make a 360 image of a product
- Run queries for product deals

These will most likely be added in the future which will show a better improvement towards this website.



# Thank you!
I enjoyed making this application and hope to continue adding more additions and hope to improve upon old and new projects
